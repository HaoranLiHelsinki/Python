Python_CALIPSO_level2_aerosol_read_plot.ipynb

This is a notebook script for reading and plotting CALIPSO level 2 aerosol data.

1. Aerosol type is derived from binary string. 
2. The distance between Sub-satellite point and ground station Zeppelin is calculated.

NOTE:

No special instruction about the dependencies, since all imported modules are very commonly used. Before running it, name Path_folder as the folder address where your CALIPSO data are saved in.

The author just started using Python, please do not be suprised by very basic programming style. 

Feedbacks and comments are highly appreciated.
